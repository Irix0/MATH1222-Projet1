"what do you mean by that?" said the caterpillar sternly. "explain yourself!" "i can't explain myself, i'm afraid, sir," said alice, "because i'm not myself, you see." "i don't see," said the caterpillar. "i'm afraid i can't put it more clearly," alice replied very politely, "for i can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing." "it isn't," said the caterpillar.
